Trainer-client application where you as a client can choose your celebrity trainer of choice and book a session with your workout preference (cardio, weight lifting, etc), session duration, specific date and time for appointment. A user books a session by either loging into their account or creating an account. Afterwards, users can make appointments for a session (POST), change your session (PATCH), or if you can no longer attend your session then you can cancel as well (DELETE). A user's booked sessions can be seen when they are logged in to their account.
